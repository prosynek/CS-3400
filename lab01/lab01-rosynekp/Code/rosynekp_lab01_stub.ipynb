You will have a username on ROSIE by the start of class, but if it is a new account you may have to reset your password. Ask your instructor for the default password. At the current time, to do this you will have to access the terminal on ROSIE - meaning you will have to ssh in. Once you have reset your password, you will be able to access ROSIE's web portal and initiate interactive session from there. The following steps and sections will give you what you need to start.\n",

You should access [ROSIE's web portal](http://dh-ood.hpc.msoe.edu/) and start a jupyter notebook session to run (and complete) this notebook."
